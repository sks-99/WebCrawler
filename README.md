# WebCrawler

## Instructions
Install beautifulsoup by following the instructions here https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup

### To Run
Note: this was only tested on Windows
Dataset folder must be created in the same directory as crawler.py and empty. since git cannot push an empty directory, you must create one until we have our own dataset
1. put your search terms in the search_terms list
2. in main(), choose whether you would like All Google Results or Google News results by passing their respective function into parse_webpage

## TO-DOs:
- come up with our own search terms (i.e., replace placeholders and generate the actual articles for the dataset)
